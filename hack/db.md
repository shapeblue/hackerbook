# CloudStack DB

## Upgrade Paths

CloudStack has its own database framework that is based on
[DAO](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/dataaccessobject-138824.html).

CloudStack uses MySQL as the database, any schema for any feature maybe define
in SQL. Before you start understanding and defining the DAO framework and its
usage in CloudStack, understand how CloudStack schema is defined and upgraded.
Use of terminal based `mysql-client` is recommended, you may also use [MySQL
workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/).

CloudStack has following databases:
- `cloud`: the main database where most of CloudStack tables are
- `cloud_usage`: the database used by the usage server for usage record generation
- `simulator`: the database used by simulator plugin (only for developers, not
  for production usage)

The `DatabaseUpgradeChecker` class is responsible for CloudStack schema upgrade.
When the management server starts, an instance of this class kicks in to
check the version of the schema based on the `cloud.version` table against the
code version (from the jar). This class defines a map/sequence/hierarchy of
upgrade paths from a starting version number. The upgrade path is a class
that implements the `DbUpgrade` interface. For example, if the code version
(as defined in the root pom.xml file) is `4.12.0.0-SNAPSHOT` look for an upgrade
path class that may be named as `Upgrade4XXXXto41200`. This class would define
two sql scripts, one that upgrades CloudStack's schema and other that runs
to perform any schema cleanup. This class also defines metadata about the
upgrade path, the from/to version ranges etc. You may use any of the existing
upgrade paths to learn how to write one as well.

## Defining Schema

Pick the upgrade path for which you intend your feature for (i.e. the target
CloudStack version), and add relevant schema to that sql upgrade path file
(for example, `META-INF/db/schema-41120to41200.sql`). For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `cloud`.`coffee` (
  `id` bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `uuid` varchar(40) UNIQUE,
  `name` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `state` varchar(40) NOT NULL,
  `account_id` bigint unsigned NOT NULL,
  `created` datetime NOT NULL COMMENT 'date of creation',
  `removed` datetime COMMENT 'date of removal',
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY (`uuid`),
  KEY `i_coffee` (`name`, `account_id`, `created`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8;
```

Tips:
- Avoid using plural form for the table name (for example, `cloud.user` not
  `cloud.users`)
- Don't create schema keys that you won't need
- For performance gains use `views` instead of simply the `tables`, the general
  use case could be to speed up list API execution

## Resource DAO

**Recommended reading**: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Data+Access+Layer

CloudStack data access layer is implemented by `GenericDaoBase` abstract class
that implements the DAO. For feature/resource specific tables, you would usually
implement a `Dao` interface that defines the contract for the `DaoImpl`, the
implementation class would extend `GenericDaoBase`.

The VO (view object) captures the schema/table and a VO instance typically
represents a row in the table. The VO typically implements the resource
interface (contract), however for purpose of any subsystem consuming a resource
object, the resource interface should be used/passed around than a VO instance.

The VO class exports and uses several annotations for its table/db fields and
`@Table` to define the name of the table that the VO represents. Most CloudStack
tables have an internal (bigint) ID or database `id`, but the resources are
queried by users based on an external string based `uuid`.

Define the `VO` and make it implement the feature/resource interface. For
example:

```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "coffee")
public class CoffeeVO implements Coffee {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    @Column(name = "id")
    private long id;

    @Column(name = "uuid")
    private String uuid;

    @Column(name = "name")
    private String name;

    @Column(name = "state", nullable = false)
    @Enumerated(value = EnumType.STRING)
    private CoffeeState state = CoffeeState.Created;

    @Column(name = "account_id")
    private long accountId;

    @Column(name = GenericDao.CREATED_COLUMN)
    protected Date created;

    @Column(name = GenericDao.REMOVED_COLUMN)
    protected Date removed;

    // This empty constructor is needed for reflection to work
    public CoffeeVO() {
        uuid = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
    }

    // Custom constructor example
    public CoffeeVO(String name, long accountId) {
        this.uuid = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
        this.name = name;
        this.accountId = accountId;
    }

    // more custom constructors, getters, setters etc.
```

Define the `Dao` interface, for example:

```java
package org.apache.cloudstack.feature.dao;

public interface CoffeeDao extends GenericDao<CoffeeVO, Long> {
    // method definitions here
}
```

Define the `DaoImpl`, for example:

```java
package org.apache.cloudstack.feature.dao;

public class CoffeeDaoImpl extends GenericDaoBase<CoffeeVO, Long> implements CoffeeDao {
    // method implementations here
}
```

Declare the `DaoImpl` in the spring context xml file so that a bean gets created
and can be injected in the service layer class. For example:

```xml
--- a/plugins/hackerbook/feature/src/main/resources/META-INF/cloudstack/feature/spring-feature-context.xml
+++ b/plugins/hackerbook/feature/src/main/resources/META-INF/cloudstack/feature/spring-feature-context.xml
@@ -2,6 +2,9 @@
        xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
        xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans
                       http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans.xsd">
     <bean id="coffeeManager" class="org.apache.cloudstack.feature.CoffeeManagerImpl" />
+    <bean id="coffeeDao" class="org.apache.cloudstack.feature.dao.CoffeeDaoImpl" />
```

Now, the `DaoImpl` class can be injected and used by the service/manager class.
For example:

```java
public class CoffeeManagerImpl extends ManagerBase implements CoffeeManager, Configurable, PluggableService {
    // .. code redacted ..
    @Inject
    private CoffeeDao coffeeDao;
    // .. code redacted ..
    @Override
    public List<Coffee> listCoffees(ListCoffeesCmd cmd) {
        // Perform validations checks etc. following is just an example
        return new ArrayList<>(coffeeDao.listAll());
    }
    // .. code redacted ..
    @Override
    @ActionEvent(eventType = EventTypes.EVENT_COFFEE_CREATE, eventDescription = "creating coffee", async = true)
    public Coffee createCoffee(CreateCoffeeCmd cmd) {
        // Perform validations checks etc. following is just an example
        return coffeeDao.persist(new CoffeeVO(cmd.getName(), CallContext.current().getCallingAccountId()));
    }
```

By default, the Dao will have several ready to use methods such as `listAll`,
`findById`, `update`, `persist`, `remove` etc. When persisting a new VO, your
code does not need to create/set the `id`, `created` which are handled by the
DAO framework (GenericDaoBase).

Read the DAO wiki article to know various building blocks and utilities you can
use to create custom methods for searching and querying (for example, the
`SearchBuilder`).

### NOTE :
> The ORM uses interceptors to track which fields of a VO have changed to construct the SQL query.
It determines the field / column to be searched or updated from the getter or setter used.
Therefore it is important to name the getters and setters properly.
eg: A variable "abc" should have the appropriate getter "getAbc()" and setter "setAbc()".
It is safer to allow the IDE to create the getters / setters. Be especially careful with boolean variables,
which need to follow the same get / set prefix for thier getters and setters rather than is / enable / disable.

## DB Transactions

**Recommended reading**: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CLOUDSTACK/Database+Transactions

You can wrap a set of complex DB operations (for example, deleting of details
when coffee is deleted/removed) in a DB transaction using the `Transaction`
utility. For example:

```java
    return Transaction.execute(new TransactionCallback<CoffeeVO>() {
        @Override
        public CoffeeVO doInTransaction(TransactionStatus status) {
            return coffeeDao.persist(new CoffeeVO(name, accountId));
        }
    });
```

## Resource Details Dao

For any resource, a details table can be designed as well. The VOs and Daos
can be implemented in the same way. Typically a `_details` table will have
following columns:
- `id`: the auto increment internal DB ID (bigint)
- `resource_id`: the (bigint) ID of the resource
- `name`: the name/key of the detail (string)
- `value`: the value of the detail (string)
- `display`: boolean (int:1) to show/hide that detail

The `VO` class for the resource detail table can implement `ResourceDetail`
interface. The `Dao` interface can extend the `ResourceDetailsDao<R>` interface
and the `DaoImpl` class can extend the `ResourceDetailsDaoBase<RVO>` abstract
class. Using this pattern, your resource's `DetailsDao` can be used to
list/add/remove/save details.

## FSM

A Finite State Machine or
[FSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) defines a transition
table that takes in a state and an event to transition to a new state. In
CloudStack, FSM is used to implement state machine and restrict how state of a
resource such as a VM, volume, network etc. transition given an event occurs.
The resource state and events are both defined as `enum`, usually in the
resource interface. The resource interface need to extend the `StateObject<S>`
interface. For example:

```java
public interface Coffee extends InternalIdentity, Identity, StateObject<Coffee.CoffeeState> {
    // .. code redacted ..
    enum Event {
        OrderReceived,
        OrderReady,
        OrderDiscarded
    }

    enum CoffeeState {
        Created, Brewing, Brewed, Discarded;

        private final static StateMachine2<CoffeeState, Event, Coffee> FSM = new StateMachine2<>();
        static {
            FSM.addTransition(Created, Event.OrderReceived, Brewing);
            FSM.addTransition(Brewing, Event.OrderReady, Brewed);
            FSM.addTransitionFromStates(Event.OrderDiscarded, Discarded, Created, Brewing, Brewed);
        }

        public static StateMachine2<CoffeeState, Event, Coffee> getStateMachine() {
            return FSM;
        }
    }

    // .. code redacted ..
    CoffeeState getState();
```

The resource specific `Dao` class needs to handle state transitions, Daos of
resources that are `StateObject` can extend/implement `StateDao<S, E, V>`.

```java
public interface CoffeeDao extends GenericDao<CoffeeVO, Long>, StateDao<Coffee.CoffeeState, Coffee.Event, Coffee> {
    // .. code redacted ..
```

The `DaoImpl` can implement `updateState`. For example:

```java
public class CoffeeDaoImpl extends GenericDaoBase<CoffeeVO, Long> implements CoffeeDao {

    @Override
    public boolean updateState(Coffee.CoffeeState currentState, Coffee.Event event, Coffee.CoffeeState nextState, Coffee vo, Object data) {
        // Update logic/check here
        // May use an update_counter from the vo for lock-free update
        vo.setState(nextState);
        return update(vo.getId(), (CoffeeVO) vo);
    }
```

Tip: due to several threads of execution and multiple management server, it may
be possible that for the same resource object (VO instance) its `state` may get
updated. For this purpose, in several CloudStack VOs an `update_counter` may be
defined that ties up with the updates of its `State`. This provides a lock-free
mechanism of updating a resource state, where the logic is simply enforced using
a `SearchBuilder` that updates a `VO` object based on its previous update
counter value and its previous state. For example, see `VolumeVO` and
`VolumeDaoImpl`.

With the FSM implemented and DAO made state-aware, the FSM can be then used to
transit to a state based on an event which can automatically handle any DB
updates. This can be done by having a utility method that uses FSM's `transitTo`
method. For example, the following method in the service/manager impl class:

```java
    private boolean stateTransitTo(Coffee coffee, Coffee.Event event) throws NoTransitionException {
        return Coffee.CoffeeState.getStateMachine().transitTo(coffee, event, null, coffeeDao);
    }
```

You can also add a listener of state changes to a CloudStack FSM using
`registerListener()`, the listener could be any class that implements the
`StateListener<S, E, V>` interface.

## Exercises

1. Implement the VO, Dao and DaoImpl classes for your feature, for each of the
   schema/tables `coffee` and `coffee_details`.

2. Integrate DB with the service layer, ensure all the APIs actually perform CRUD
   against the DB.

3. Write/update the unit tests (tip: use `mockito` to mock db interactions for
   the manager impl unit test, you can run a unit test using
   `@RunWith(MockitoJUnitRunner.class)`, and use `@Spy` and `@InjectMocks` on
   your service/manager impl class).

4. Implement FSM, use events for state transition and integrate it with a custom
   brewing simulation algorithm that introduces random sleep intervals. Finish
   the feature based on the spec.
